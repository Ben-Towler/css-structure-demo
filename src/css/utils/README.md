# Utils

The `utils/` folder contains utility classes. Utility classes are CSS classes that serve one particular purpose, and are named as such. 

As a rule, we always prefix utility classes with a `u-` this makes them easy to differentiate from components & layout.

An example of common utility classes you may see:

```
.u-text-center {
  text-align: center;
}

.u-text-left {
  text-align: left;
}
```

## Please note
It's important to understand that with well structured CSS following BEM conventions, you should really have very little need for utility classes.
